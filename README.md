# instagram-scrapper

Currently instagram scrapper will scrape only the home page of yours with max 24 images and download them locally. Without using API it will ask you for login credentials and after all authentication it will save cookies locally with ./.cookies.txt and then it will scrape images and download them sequentially.

To-do list:

1. Give options to download all images from any particular profile
2. Gets loads of images from any particular hash-tag (may require extra knowledge of scraping related javascript and networking.)
